You will need to put my `clmuphantomlib` in the directory where the symbolic link is pointing to.
(See github link at the bottom of this page.)



## Disclaimer

This project is a *work in progress*.
No guarrantees whatsoever.
Use it at your own risk.

**Note: Please cite the sarracen paper if you use this code (see below link for the sarracen repository description), since this code uses sarracen behind the scene.**




## Dependencies

- Python libraries:
	- `python3` (version >= 3.10)
	- `numpy scipy astropy h5py numba matplotlib ipympl moviepy`
	- `sarracen`

- My libraries:
	- `clmuphantomlib`

(
I think that's all.
If that doesn't work, try install all of those with anaconda:
`numpy scipy astropy sympy h5py numba pandas seaborn matplotlib ipympl ipynbname pylint moviepy jupyter jupyterlab`
and then install `sarracen` with pip.
)
